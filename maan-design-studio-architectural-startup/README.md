## Challenges and Solutions
Throughout the development of this architectural startup website, several challenges arose that required thoughtful solutions to ensure a responsive, user friendly, and visually appealing experience. Below is a summary of key technical and design challenges and how they were addressed:

* **Responsive Design with Flexbox and Media Queries**  
  Implemented responsive layouts using Flexbox and media queries. For larger screens used `flex-direction: row`, while smaller screens switched to `flex-direction: column`, improving usability across devices.

* **Image Overflow Control**  
  Resolved layout issues by using `max-width: 30%` instead of `width: 30%`, ensuring images remained within their parent container without overflowing, regardless of screen size.

* **Animated Text Entrance for Enhanced UX**  
  Used CSS animations with a delay to animate text sliding in from off-screen, creating a more engaging and dynamic visual experience.

* **Client Portfolio Display with Bootstrap Carousel**  
  Utilised Bootstrap's built-in carousel component to showcase client portfolio images in a sleek, swipeable gallery.

* **Fly-out Hamburger Menu with JavaScript**  
  Built a custom responsive hamburger menu using vanilla JavaScript, enhance navigation on mobile and smaller screens with smooth open/close animations.

* **Dynamic Footer Year with JavaScript**  
  Used JavaScript to automatically generate and update the current year in the site footer, eliminating the need for manual edits in future years.

* **Page Loader Spinner for Improved UX**  
  Created a custom loading spinner using vanilla JavaScript to display before each page loads, enhancing perceived performance and user engagement.

* **Form Submit Loader for UX Feedback**  
  Added a loader spinner to the contact form's submit button using vanilla JavaScript, providing visual feedback during the form submission process.

* **Backend Form Handling with Nodemailer**  
  Used the Nodemailer npm package to handle contact form submissions and send emails reliably from the backend.

* **Error Handling for Form Submission**  
  Implemented robust error handling on form submission. The backend returns a success or error page depending on the result, ensuring users are properly informed.

* **Logo Scaling With Inkscape For Header Integration**  
  Used Inkscapte to resize and optimise the client-provided logo, ensuring it fits seamlessly within the website header while maintaining a visual quality.

* **Image Standardisation**  
  Ensured consistent image dimensions across the site to prevent distortion or blurring, especially during responsive scaling.
